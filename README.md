# simulated-ecommerce-eda
A learn-by-doing mini-project with understanding how discounts, tariff taxes and pricing affect on the total sales and revenue in a simulated ecommerce environment.

### 📌 Goals
- Simulate (roughly) realistic e-commerce datasets
- Analyze sales and consumers behaviour
- Interpretation of tariff effects on products

### Libraries used:
Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib (Python)

### 🛠️ Further refinements
- Price elasticity of demand
- Enhanced randomness through Probability distributions (Poisson, Binomal,...)
- Odd cases such policy and regulation are accountable
- Since this is EDA-groundwork, no major features will be added.
